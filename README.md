# NeuralRandUCB
RL project for the fall 2021 semester of the IFT-7201 (RL) course @ Université Laval.

This Github repository contains the code needed to carry out the experiments described in the project report. We have taken and adapted the following code: [NeuralTS](https://github.com/ZeroWeight/NeuralTS),  [RandUCB](https://github.com/vaswanis/randucb), [Personalized News Article Recommendation](https://github.com/antonismand/Personalized-News-Recommendation).

In addition, we used a sample of the R6A - Yahoo front page today module user click log dataset to perform the experiment using news article recommendation. This can be obtained from the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jkKjUaL3uyOZb1mRYC0JVy50Peja8msm/view?usp=sharing).

This file must then be included in > dataset > R6

Make sure you install the required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please note that the experiments were carried out with an NVIDIA RTX 3080 graphics card, which requires the most up-to-date version of Pytorch (1.11). This version may not work on your machine, and you may need to install an earlier version.
